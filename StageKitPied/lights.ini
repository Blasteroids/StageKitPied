[LEDS]
# The LEDs should be connected via SPI.  Set the correct device here.
DEVICE=/dev/spidev0.0
# This is the toal amount of LEDs in the array.
LED_AMOUNT=220
# This is the amount of INI files the program can look for.
INI_AMOUNT=5
# The default INI file to load.

# List the INI file names here.  The files must be in the same directory as the program.
INI1=leds1.ini

[STARTUP]
# On startup the LED array can be set to flash to show that the program is active.
# This is the amount of time to flash.
FLASH_AMOUNT=0
# This is the colour to flash the leds.
FLASH_RGB=0,255,0
# This is the delay between flashes.

# This is the brightness of the leds when they flash.
FLASH_BRIGHTNESS=15

[RB3E]
# Setting this to 1 will use RB3Enhanced network data instead of having to use an actual hardware Stage Kit.
# Use SOURCE_IP=0.0.0.0 to allow data from any IP.
# BEFORE RUNNING RB3E... in Dashlaunch, enable "sockpatch" in the network settings then when you quit RB3E disable it again.
# NOTE: At the time of writing this, if running RB3E with xenia...
#       BroadcastTarget=255.255.255.255 does not appear to work, so must be set to IP address manually in rb3.ini
#       BroadcastTarget in rb3.ini might need to be byte flipped.  Example:  192.168.1.1 becomes 1.1.168.192
#       Also LISTENING_PORT here might need to be byte flipped. Example: 21070 becomes 20050

[STAGEKIT]
# This allows/disables the lights/fog/strobe on the light pod & fogger unit.

# Note: Ensure light pod has power via USB/2 interface otherwise the leds won't turn on.

[SERIAL_INTERFACE]
# These are the ports the serial adapter is likely to be connected to.
# Default is normally ttyUSB0 but it will attempt to try ttyUSB1 if that fails.
# If for any reason the serial adapter is on any other port then set it here.
SERIAL_PORT_1=/dev/ttyUSB0

# After a while the serial adapter produces warnings but still functions ok.
# Set this to 0 to watch your screen fill up with warnings :)

[SLEEP_TIMES]
# Max sleep time per iteration loop for the program, to reduce being a resource hog.
